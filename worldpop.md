# Fetching Raster Statistics from WorldPop
[WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org) produces and hosts high-resolution open gridded datasets about 
population distributions, demographics and dynamics. 

These datasets are often made available as geoTiff raster files. 
EpigraphHub facilitates access to these files.

## Python
Let's look at some examples of how to access data from WorldPop using the 
EpigraphHub Python library.

```python
import pandas as pd
from epigraphhub.data.worldpop import WorldPop
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, Image
```
To get started we instantiate a WorlPop object to consume the API

```python
WP = WorldPop()
```

The representation (`__repr__`) of this object is a markdown table describing the contents of the API.
 So we can just take a quick look at it:

| urban_change         | Urban change                | Urban change                      | East–Southeast Asia is currently one of the fastest urbanizing regions in the world, with countries such as China climbing from 20 to 50% urbanized in just a few decades. However, spatially-and temporally-detailed information on regional-scale changes in urban land or population distribution have not previously been available; previous efforts have been either sample-based, focused on one country, or drawn conclusions from datasets with substantial temporal/spatial mismatch and variability in urban definitions. In collaboration with the World Bank and University of Wisconsin-Madison, WorldPop used consistent methodology, satellite imagery and census data for >1000 agglomerations in the East–Southeast Asian region to map population changes between 2000 and 2010.

The  datasets represent the outputs from a project focused on construction of consistent 100m resolution population count datasets for all countries of the World structured by male/female and 5-year age classes (plus a <1 year class).

| dahi                 | Development Indicators      | Development and Health Indicators | Improved understanding of geographical variation and inequity in health status, wealth and access to resources within countries is increasingly being recognized as central to meeting development goals. Development and health indicators assessed at national or subnational scale can often conceal important inequities, with the rural poor often least well represented. WorldPop develops methods for the integration of geolocated cluster sample data from household surveys with geospatial covariates in Bayesian geostatistical modelling frameworks to map key development and health indicators at high spatial resolution. These include indicators relating to poverty, literacy, sanitation, maternal and newborn health, contraceptive use and vaccination coverage, among others.

| dependency_ratios    | Dependency Ratios           | Dependency Ratios                 | The age group composition of populations varies substantially across continents and within countries, and is linked to levels of development, health status and poverty. The subnational variability in the shape of the population pyramid as well as the respective dependency ratio are reflective of the different levels of development of a country and are drivers for a country’s economic prospects and health burdens. WorldPop’s assembly of subnational population pyramid data has here been used to produce continent-wide subnational scale dependency ratio datasets, with full details found in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201789"  target="_blank">Pezzulo et al</a>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| global_flight_data   | Global Flight Data          | Global Flight Data                | The expanding global air network provides rapid and wide-reaching connections accelerating both domestic and international travel. To understand human movement patterns on the network and their socioeconomic, environmental and epidemiological implications, information on passenger flow is required. However, comprehensive data on global passenger flow remain difficult and expensive to obtain, prompting researchers and analysts to rely on scheduled flight seat capacity data or simple models of flow. WorldPop has collated openly available monthly statistics of air passengers across countries and years, and developed models of global air passenger flows, with annual flow methods described in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064317"  target="_blank">Huang et al</a>, seasonal flows described in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692315001581"  target="_blank">Mao et al</a>, and the dataset collected and output estimates available to download here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| covariates           | Covariates                  | Geospatial covariate data layers  | Recent years have seen substantial growth in openly available satellite and other geospatial data layers, which represent a range of metrics relevant to global human population mapping at fine spatial scales. The specifications of such data differ widely and therefore the harmonisation of data layers is a prerequisite to constructing detailed and contemporary spatial datasets which accurately describe population distributions. Such datasets are vital to measure impacts of population growth, monitor change, and plan interventions. To this end WorldPop has produced an open access archive of 3 and 30 arc-second resolution gridded data, which are available to download here and are described further in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20964471.2019.1625151"  target="_blank">Lloyd et al 2019</a> and also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20171"  target="_blank">Lloyd et al 2017</a>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| gbsg                 | Global Settlement Growth    | Global Built-Settlement Growth    | Changing populations are often accompanied by changing built-settlement landscapes. Here, small area population data and a limited set of environmental covariates have been combined with machine learning methods and dynamically-limited growth curves to annually interpolate (from 2000 to 2014) and annually project (from 2015 to 2020) the presence of built-settlements across the globe at 100m resolution. These annual built-settlement maps were then used to inform the WorldPop "Global per country 2000-2020" population datasets.

Their data is organized into some general categories: *"pop"*, *"births"*, *"pregnancies"*, etc.
So we need to drill down into these categories to get at the data. Let's, for instance,
drill into the population data or *"pop"* category:

```python
for df in WP.get_dataset_tables("pop"):
    display(Markdown(f"### {df['name']}: *{df['alias']}*"))
    display(df['data'])
```
The `get_dataset_tables` above returns a generator that yields all datasets in 
this category. Since this is a long list we will skip showing all of them.

From this list, We can dig deeper to get closer to the actual data: we pick an area, 
say *population (pop)*, a level, say *Unconstrained individual countries 2000-2020 ( 1km resolution ): "wpic1km"* 
and the country: *Guyana*.

```python
data = WP.get_data_by_country(alias='pop', level='wpic1km', ISO3_code='GUY')
```

Running the above code will return a JSON object describing all the raster files available 
for this level, including links from where we can download them.

We can also download a jpg thumbnail of the full geoTiff raster we want to fetch:

```python
Image(data['data'][0]['url_img'])
```
![](data/guyana.png)

then we can proceed to download the geoTiff. Let's import a couple of extra libraries first.

```python
import rioxarray as rx
import wget
```
Then

```python
wget.download(data['data'][0]['files'][0], out="guy_pop.tif")

tif = rx.open_rasterio('guy_pop.tif')
```

From the `tif` object we can do a number of further analyses with the data.
